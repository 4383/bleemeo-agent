# Agent configuration files are written in yaml.

# Configuration could be overridden by files under
# /etc/bleemeo/agent.conf.d/*.yml
# We suggest to create a file under that folder and leave this

# Files from the agent.conf.d folder are read in dictonary order (e.g.
# 00-defaults.yml is read before 99-custom.yml)

    # Agent will generate few values the first time it's started:
    # * a couple (login, password) used to communicated over MQTT and send to
    #   Bleemeo during the registration (over HTTPS).
    # * and a secret_key used by local web-server
    # It will store them in this file.

# You can define a threshold on ANY metric. You only need to know it's name and
# add an entry like this one:
#   metric_name:
#       low_critical: 1.0
#       low_warning: 2.0
#       high_warning: 3
#       high_critical: 4.2
# You can omit any of the above 4 threshold (or explicitly set it to null).

thresholds:
    cpu_idle:
        # When cpu_idle fall bellow 10%, it is critical. 20 % is warning.
        # Note: cpu_* threshold "scale" with the number of core, e.g. on a
        # quad-core, total CPU is 400%, a value of 10 means 10 * 4 = 40% of the
        # total 400%.
