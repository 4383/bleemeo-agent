Bleemeo Agent
=============

Bleemeo Agent have been designed to be a central piece of
a monitoring infrastructure. It gather all information and
send it to... something. We provide drivers for storing in
an InfluxDB database directly or a secure connection (MQTT over SSL) to
Bleemeo Cloud platform.


Quickstart
----------

If you want to try bleemeo-agent, here are the step to run from a git checkout:

* create a virtualenv.
* Install dependencies and "install" bleemeo-agent::

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop

* Install collectd and configure it::

    sudo apt-get install collectd
    sudo install -m 0644 debian/bleemeo-agent.collectd.conf /etc/collectd/collectd.conf.d/bleemeo.conf
    sudo service collectd restart

* Run bleemeo-agent from repository root (where README and setup.py are)::

    bleemeo-agent

* Bleemeo agent have a local web UI accessible on http://localhost:8015, it
  will also write in InfluxDB on localhost if installed.

The "python setup.py develop" will install bleemeo-agent and run it from the
git checkout directly. It allow you to modify the code and see change without
need to re-install the agent.

Note that change to setup.py (especialy change to entry_points) will still need
to re-run python setup.py develop.
